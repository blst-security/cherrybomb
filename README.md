# üí£ What is Cherrybomb?
Cherrybomb is a CLI tool that helps you avoid undefined user behavior by validating your API specifications and running API security tests.


# üî® How does it work?
Cherrybomb reads your API spec file (Open API Specification) and validates it for best practices and the [OAS specification](https://swagger.io/specification/),
then it tests to verify that the API follows the OAS file and tests for common vulnerabilities.</br>
The output is a detailed table with any issues found, guiding you to the exact problem and location to help you solve it quickly.

# üêæ Get Started
## Installation
#### Using cURL
##### Linux/MacOS:
```
curl https://cherrybomb.blstsecurity.com/install	| /bin/bash
```
The script requires sudo permissions to move the cherrybomb bin into <b>/usr/local/bin/</b>.</br>
(If you want to view the shell script(or even help to improving it - [/scripts/install.sh](/scripts/install.sh))

#### Get it from crates.io
```bash
cargo install cherrybomb
```
If you don't have cargo installed, you can install it from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

#### Docker container
You can use our docker container that we host on our public repo in aws, though we require an API key for it, you can get it at [our CI pipeline integration wizard](https://www.blstsecurity.com/Loading?redirect=/CICD&promo=blst&domain=github_wiz_docker)(after you sign up)
```
docker run --mount type=bind,source=PATH_TO_OAS_DIR,destination=/home public.ecr.aws/t1d5k0l0/cherrybomb:latest cherrybomb oas -f home/OAS_NAME --api-key=API-KEY
```
#### Clone
You can also install Cherrybomb by cloning this repo, and building it using cargo(*only works with the nightly toolchain):
```
git clone https://github.com/blst-security/cherrybomb && cd cherrybomb
cargo build --release
sudo mv ./target/release/cherrybomb /usr/local/bin
```

## Usage
After installing the CLI, verify it's working by running
```
cherrybomb --version
```

### OpenAPI specification scan
```
cherrybomb oas --file <PATH> --format <cli/txt/json> 
```
#### Output example:
![passive output](/images/passive.png)
![active output](/images/active.png)

### Generate Parameter Table
```
cherrybomb param-table --file <PATH> --name <SINGLE PARAM NAME(OPTIONAL)>
```

#### Table output example:
![param_table](/images/param_table.png)

### Generate Endpoint Table
```
cherrybomb ep-table --file <PATH> --name <SINGLE PARAM NAME(OPTIONAL)>
```
#### Table output example:
![ep_table](/images/ep_table.png)

# üçª Integration

You can embed it into your CI pipeline, and If you plan on doing that I would recommend that you go to our [website](https://www.blstsecurity.com/?promo=blst&domain=github_integration_link), sign up, go through the [CI pipeline integration wizard](https://www.blstsecurity.com/Loading?redirect=/CICD&promo=blst&domain=github_wiz_integration), and copy the groovy/GitHub actions snippet built for you.
